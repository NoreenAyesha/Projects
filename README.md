# Fake-image-Detection
Project 1
Fake image detection in the internet world refers to the process of identifying and classifying images that have been manipulated, altered or fabricated using digital tools. With the rise of social media and easy access to image-editing software, fake images have become a major concern for internet users. These images can be used for various malicious purposes, such as spreading false information, propaganda, fraud, and cyberbullying.

Fake image detection plays a crucial role in combating these issues by allowing users to verify the authenticity of images they encounter online. It involves the use of various algorithms and techniques to analyze the image's content and identify any signs of manipulation, such as inconsistencies in lighting, shadows, and reflections.

The importance of fake image detection is clear, as it helps prevent the spread of fake news and misinformation, protects individuals and organizations from cybercrime and fraud, and ensures the integrity and authenticity of visual content online. In addition, it promotes ethical standards in the use of images and promotes trust and transparency in online communications.

Overall, fake image detection is a vital tool in the fight against online deception and is increasingly becoming an essential aspect of internet safety and security.

# Agricultural Production Optimization Engine
project 2
As we all know that agriculture depends largely on the nature of soil and the climatic conditions and many a times, we face unpredictable changes in climate like, non-seasonal rainfall or heat waves or fluctuations in humidity levels, etc. and all such events cause a great loss to our farmers and farming, because of which they are not able to utilize their agricultural land to it's fullest.So to solve all such problems, I have build a Machine Learning Model by the virtue of which we can help farmers, optimize the agricultural production, because this predictive model will help them understand that for a particular soil & given climatic condition, which crop will be best suitable for the harvest.

There are 7 key factors that I've taken into account which will help us in determining, exactly which crop should be grown and at what period of time, viz. Amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium in soil, Temperature in degree celcius, Humidity, pH and Rainfall in mm.

Tools used: Python & Jupyter Notebook Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ipywidgets and sklearn. Machine Learning Algorithms used: Clustering Analysis and Logistic Regression.
